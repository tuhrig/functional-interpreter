This package provides access to all java classes on the class-
path through the interpreter. It contains classes that represents
instances, instance-methods, instances-fields, classes, class-methods 
and class-fields. Every such class wraps a specific instance, class,
or method. Theses Java types are called through reflexion.

Example 1:

(lambda (list) (.getRest list))

This user-defined function will call a method called "getRest" on a
given object (list). If the object has no such method, an error will
be thrown. Otherwise, the method will be called and the result will be
returned.

Example 2:

(import "java.awt.event.*")		
(import "javax.swing.*")
(import "java.lang.*")
(import "java.awt.*")

(define win (JFrame. "JavaExample1"))
(define visible (Boolean. true))
(.setVisible win visible))

This example imports some java packages and creates an instance of a JFrame.
After that, it sets is visible.

The syntax is described in the README.md.
